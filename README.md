Rebound Source Code
=========================

This repository contains the source code for Rebound, an online multiplayer video game.
It has a corresponding matchmaking server which can be found [here](https://github.com/jwparsons/Rebound_MatchmakingServer).
If you would like to try playing Rebound, the demo (and instructions) can be found [here](https://github.com/jwparsons/Rebound_Demo).

Rebound was created using Unreal Engine 4.17. 
Building the server binaries requires that UE4 be [built from source](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine).

This project was created by me and my partner Tyler Kelly for the class Concurrent, Parallel, & Distributed Programming at FSU.
I was responsible for game design, artwork, mechanics, multiplayer support, and the matchmaking system.
Enjoy!
