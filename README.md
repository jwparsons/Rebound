Rebound Source Code
=========================

# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for Rebound, an online multiplayer video game.
It has a corresponding [matchmaking server](https://github.com/jwparsons/Rebound_MatchmakingServer) and [demo](https://github.com/jwparsons/Rebound_Demo) (with instructions).

# Requirements
Rebound was created using Unreal Engine 4.17.
It uses the [SocketIO Plugin](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) for client/matchmaking server communication.
Building the game server binaries requires that UE4 be [built from source](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine).

# Contribution
This project was created by me and Tyler Kelly for the class Concurrent, Parallel, & Distributed Programming at FSU.
I was responsible for game design, artwork, mechanics, multiplayer support, and the matchmaking system.
Enjoy!
